# Environments

## This directory would contain the enviroment directories for other fodlers, in the case of this project, as it is only a demo, there is only a singular 'test' directory. In an actual business use case you may choose to have multiple, such as dev, staging, prod, etc.

Within the `live/enviroment/<env name>/` directory you should also have a directory with the name of each compnent you wish to have in that enviroment. Within that directory place a `terragrunt.hcl` file with the correct dependencies and inputs for that compnent.

Below is an example of what that might look like

```bash



```
